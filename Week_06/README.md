# Week 6 Notes - 30.10.2019

* Do not forget to check lecture slides before exam. Lab sessions are for solving as much example question as possible. Thus there could be some concepts that we didn't cover in the Lab sessions, such as do while and continue.

#### Exam Tips
* **Confidence Boost:** Start with the easiest question that you can solve the fastest.
* **Human First:** As a human, how do you solve the question, try to solve it on the computer that way.
* **Be The Computer:** Can't find the result you want on the screen? Then run your code line by line with pen and paper. Particularly in loops, to observe the values of your variables, print them on the screen. But do not forget to erase the print lines before submission.
* **Initialization**: Don't forget to assign initial values to variables. Especially variables that store sums or multiplications.
* **Messages**: Warnings and Errors are not your enemies, on the contrary they are your friends.
* **Indentation**: Indentation

### Question 6 - Prime Example

#### Question 6a
Write a  program that reads a positive integer number and prints "Prime" to the screen if the entered number is a Prime number, otherwise "Prime Not".

#### Question 6b
Write a  program that reads two positive integer numbers and prints all the prime numbers between (inclusive) them. You may assume that the first entered number will always be smaller than the second number.

|  INPUT  |  OUTPUT |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| 3 22 | 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 |
