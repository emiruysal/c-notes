### Question 5 - Positivity

#### Question 5a
Write a program that reads an integer. If the integer is positive then print "positive", if it is not then print "not positive".

#### Question 5b
Write a program that reads an integer. If the integer is positive then print "positive", if it is negative then print "negative", if it is zero then print "zero".

#### Question 5c
Write a program that reads an integer. If the integer is positive then check if the number is odd or even and then print "odd" or "even", if it is negative then print the absolute value of the number, if it is zero then print "zero".

|  INPUT  |  OUTPUT |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| 4  | even   |
| -5  | 5  |
| 0  | zero  |

<br />

### Question 6 - Calculator (Lab3 Q4)

Write a basic calculator program (+, -, *, /). The program takes three inputs: float, char, float, then prints the result.
